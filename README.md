# Cancer Genomic Project using Machine Learning Algorithms

### Project Description:

This project entails the analysis and classification of cancer genomics data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). It's designed to aid oncologists and researchers in understanding cancer types through machine learning models.

### Objectives:

- To classify cancer types from genomic data.
  
- To provide a predictive model aiding in personalized cancer treatment.

### Methodology:

**Data Collection:** Sourced from TCGA, focusing on various cancer types.

**Data Preprocessing:** Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction.

**Model Development:** Utilized machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.

**Evaluation:** Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Tools Used

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib

### Attached 
- The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the step-by-step process of data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

- Documentation provides insights into the methodologies and findings.
